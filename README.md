NFS Reloaded
===========

About
-----
This is a simple car racing game in which you have to save your car from the oncoming cars. This was created as a school project using the historical TurboC compiler and uses headers such as graphics.h, conio.h and dos.h. Couldn't get this to compile on modern machines. I may port this to a modern GUI toolkit sometime.
